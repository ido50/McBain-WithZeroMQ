=head1 NAME
 
McBain::WithZeroMQ - Load a McBain API as a ZeroMQ service

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	# write your API as you normally would, and create
	# a simple start-up script:

	#!/usr/bin/perl -w

	BEGIN { $ENV{MCBAIN_WITH} = 'WithZeroMQ'; }

	use warnings;
	use strict;
	use MyAPI;

	MyAPI->work('localhost', 5560);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<McBain::WithZeroMQ> turns your L<McBain> API into a L<ZeroMQ REP worker|ZMQ::LibZMQ3>,
making it easy to consume your APIs with ZMQ REQ clients. The generated worker code is based
on the L<request-reply worker example|http://zguide.zeromq.org/pl:rrworker> in the L<ZeroMQ guide|http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all>. Note that the ZeroMQ request-reply pattern requires
a broker. The guide also has examples for L<a broker|http://zguide.zeromq.org/pl:rrbroker>
and L<a client|http://zguide.zeromq.org/pl:rrclient>, though two scripts based on these examples
are also provided with this module - more for example than actual usage - see L<mcbain-zmq-broker>
and L<mcbain-zmq-client>, respectively.

The workers created by this module receive payloads in JSON format, and convert them into the 
hash-refs your API's methods expect to receive. The payload must have a C<path> key, which holds
the complete path of the route/method to invoke (for example, C<GET:/status>). Results are sent
back to the clients in JSON as well. Note that if an API method does not return a hash-ref, this runner
module will automatically turn it into a hash-ref to ensure that conversion into JSON will
be possible. The created hash-ref will have one key - holding the method's name, with whatever
was returned from the method as its value. For example, if method C<GET:/divide> in topic
C</math> returns an integer (say 7), then the client will get the JSON C<{ "GET:/math/divide": 7 }>.

=head1 METHODS EXPORTED TO YOUR API

=head2 work( [ $host, $port ] )

Connects the ZeroMQ worker created by the module to the ZeroMQ broker
running at the host and port provided. If none are provided, C<localhost>
and C<5560> are used, respectively.

The method never returns, so that the worker listens for jobs continuously.

=head1 METHODS REQUIRED BY MCBAIN

This runner module implements the following methods required by C<McBain>:

=head2 init( )

Creates the L</"work( $host, $port )"> method for the root topic of the API.

=cut

sub init {
	my ($class, $target) = @_;

	if ($target->is_root) {
		no strict 'refs';
		*{"${target}::work"} = sub {
			my ($pkg, $host, $port) = @_;

			$host ||= 'localhost';
			$port ||= 5560;

			my $context = zmq_init();

			# Socket to talk to clients
			my $responder = zmq_socket($context, ZMQ_REP);
			zmq_connect($responder, "tcp://${host}:${port}");

			while (1) {
				# Wait for next request from client
				my $size = zmq_recv($responder, my $buf, $MAX_MSGLEN);
				return undef if $size < 0;
				my $payload = substr($buf, 0, $size);

				# Process the request
				my $res = $pkg->call($payload);

				# Send reply back to client
				zmq_send($responder, $res, -1);
			}
		};
	}
}

=head2 generate_env( $job )

Receives the JSON payload and generates C<McBain>'s standard env
hash-ref from it.

=cut

sub generate_env {
	my ($self, $payload) = @_;

	$payload = $json->decode($payload);

	confess { code => 400, error => "Payload does not define path to invoke" }
		unless $payload->{path};

	confess { code => 400, error => "Namespace must match <METHOD>:<ROUTE> where METHOD is one of GET, POST, PUT, DELETE or OPTIONS" }
		unless $payload->{path} =~ m/^(GET|POST|PUT|DELETE|OPTIONS):[^:]+$/;

	my ($method, $route) = split(/:/, delete($payload->{path}));

	return {
		METHOD	=> $method,
		ROUTE		=> $route,
		PAYLOAD	=> $payload
	};
}

=head2 generate_res( $env, $res )

Converts the result from an API method in JSON. Read the discussion under
L</"DESCRIPTION"> for more info.

=cut

sub generate_res {
	my ($self, $env, $res) = @_;

	$res = { $env->{METHOD}.':'.$env->{ROUTE} => $res }
		unless ref $res eq 'HASH';

	return encode_json($res);
}

=head2 handle_exception( $err )

Simply calls C<< $job->send_fail >> to return a job failed
status to the client.

=cut

sub handle_exception {
	my ($class, $err) = @_;

	return $json->encode($err);
}
